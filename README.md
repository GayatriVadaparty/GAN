Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are neural networks that generate media, like images, music, speech, or text, that is similar to what humans produce.

It has been  “the most interesting idea in the last 10 years” in the field of machine learning. This repository has code which is implementing a generative model

Generative adversarial networks can also generate high-dimensional samples such as images. In this project, I'm going to use a GAN to generate images of handwritten digits. For that, I’ll train the models using the MNIST dataset of handwritten digits, which is included in the torchvision package.
